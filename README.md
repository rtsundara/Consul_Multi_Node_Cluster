# Consul_Multi_Node_Cluster
Consul Multi Node service mesh using Macbook, Raspberry Pi and Windows Laptop

I wanted to learn Consul cluster bringup, service mesh and KV store. Since we are stuck @ home, ended up brining up a Consul cluster with nodes scatterred in my home LAN/WLAN.

Windows PC --> Consul Server
MBP --> Consul Client 1
Raspi --> Consul Client 2
